# About me

Hi, my name is. I'm 22 years old, and for most of my life I have been passionate about all kinds of creative processes. Until this day, I have dedicated my studies and free time to learning and searching for my personal creative language. I don't want to limit myself only to the "graphic designer" category, because I think I am a little more than that. I search for this creative passion of mine all over the planet, not only on my Mac or in some art history book. I understand design as a creative process that must come from deeper layers of the self, and for that, you may need to think more interdisciplinarily. With this said, please try to enjoy these glimpses of my school work for this semester which unfortunately cannot fully capture my personal insight into design as a whole.
